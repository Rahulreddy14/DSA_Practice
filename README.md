# DSA_progress

Creating this repository to work on the DSA Leetcode problems and track it along the way
total areas to complete
https://neetcode.io/practice

The goal of this Read me file is to have the Journalling of all the learnings I am gonna make while grinding Leet code and document it so it can easy to revise when ever needed.
This is a 100 days grinding of leetcode.

## GOAL - To Complete the Blind 75 List of the coding Questions

# Arrays And Hashing

# Two Pointers

# Sliding Window

# Stack

# Binary Search

# Linked List

## Problems from Blind 75

- [ ] **Reverse Linked List**

- [ ] **Merge Sorted Lists**

- [ ] **Reorder List**

  - first find the middle. use slow and fast pointers to find the middle
  - reverse the second half of the linked list
  - now merge the two halfs, using two pointers and two temporary variables

- [] **Remove Nth Node from the End of the List**

  - Just create a Dummy node
    Use two Pointers, start the left from the dummy node. right one starts with the n nodes from the head given in the question
  - move the pointers untill the right points to None
  - then remove the next node of left pointer

- [ ] **Linked List Cycle**

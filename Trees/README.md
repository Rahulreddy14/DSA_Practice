### Tree Basics

Basically, a tree is a heirarchial data structure that is formed by nodes connected by edges.
It has a single node called root and has zero or more sub trees

- Node : The fundamental unit of tree. this stores the data and may have links to other nodes
- Edge : the connection between the nodes
- Root : The topmost **NODE** of the tree that has no parent
- Leaf : Terminal Node that has no children
- Internal Node : A node with atleast one children
- Subtree : Any node and all its descendants form a sub tree

1. Properties of a tree

- Height - The length of the longest path from the root to a leaf
- depth - length of the path from the root to the node
- level - The level of a node is defined by 1 + the number of connections between the node and the root.
- Degree: The number of children of a node.
- Balanced Tree: A tree where the difference between the heights of left and right subtrees is at most one for every node.

> Work on understanding the Concept of Balanced Trees

Keywords : Root, Parent Node, Child Node, Leaf node, Siblings, Depth, height

Types of Trees :

### Tree Traversals

#### Depth First Search

- Pre Order Traversal
- In Order Traversal
- Post Order Traversal

#### Breadth First Search

- Level Order Traversal

### Tree Operations

- Insertion
- Deletion
- Search
- Traversal
- height Calculation
- Checking Balance
- Lowest Common Ancestor
- Tree Construction

### Miscellinious

- Creating a Tree

- Implementing Traversals
- Common Algorithms
  - Search Algorithms
    Search functions for both general trees and BSTs
  - Insertion and Deletion
    Insertions and deletions in a BST
  - Balance Check
